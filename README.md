# Data-Science-Salary-Analysis
This is a Python EDA on the Data Science Salary dataset provided by @10Alytics.

Data science jobs are some of the fastest-growing, most in-demand in technology. Since 2012, Data Scientist roles have increased by 650 percent, and this rise shows no sign of stopping. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the demand for data science skills will increase another 27.9 percent by 2026. And, according to a report from McKinsey, that spells a shortage of between 140,000 and 190,000 people with analytical skills in the U.S. alone—not to mention another 1.5 million managers and analysts who will be required to understand how data analysis drives decision-making.
Data Scientist salaries have also risen with demand; Data Scientists can typically expect to make six figures. Demand also translates into an ability to relocate far more easily—from city to city, and even internationally.

# Statement of Problem
Eplore every features in the dataset;
1. Work Year Analysis (with Salary, Remote Ratio)
2. Experience Level Analysis (with Emplyment type, Top 3 Job title, Company size)
3. Company Location Analysis (with Experience level)
4. Salary Analysis (with Work year, Experience level, Company size, Job title, Remote ratio).

# Interpretation of Analysis/Observation
- The dataset reveals that an increasing proportion of workers are opting for fully remote work over the years, surpassing both partially remote and no remote work options, indicating a positive relationship.
The data analysis indicates a strong association between full-time employment and senior-level positions. The majority of full-time employees hold senior-level roles.
The top three job titles based on experience level are senior level (48.2%), junior level (36.7%), and entry level (15.1%).
In comparison to other professions, the data reveals that Data Scientists receive the highest salary, followed closely by BI Analysts.
CL is the location where the highest average salary is paid, closely followed by HU, according to the analysis.
# Recommendations:
Companies located in different regions can consider hiring employees as freelancers to minimize their overhead and reduce business costs. Additionally, as indicated by historical data and analysis, remote work is a prevailing trend that can enable companies to operate efficiently while delivering quality output. This approach is particularly advantageous for small-sized firms seeking to scale and increase their revenue generation. Small companies should prioritize investing in their employees' technical knowledge in Data Science and Business Intelligence (BI) analysis. Furthermore, they should incorporate more entry-level Data Scientists and Data Analysts, allowing them to learn and grow under the guidance of experienced and trained personnel.
